Movit 1.2.0, September 24th, 2015

  - Movit now ships a version.h with a #define MOVIT_VERSION that
    increases on every API change, including in git. (The number
    itself carries no semantic meaning beyond this.) Movit 1.2.0
    is not API or ABI compatible with 1.1.x, so there has been a
    soname bump to libmovit.so.3.

  - More flexible Y'CbCr input; in particular, a special input
    for 4:2:2 interleaved data (UYVY), and support for semi-planar
    input (Cb and Cr in the same texture, like in NV12). Note that
    you should now also set the new “num_levels” member of
    YCbYCbCrFormat to 256 (signifying 8-bit input), although
    it is not used yet; this is a stepping stone towards supporting
    10- and 12-bit Y'CbCr.

  - Basic support for Y'CbCr _output_. Currently only 8-bit,
    and only 4:4:4 (ie., you'll need to subsample yourself
    afterwards). It is possible to split the output into multiple
    textures, though, if you want a luma/chroma split (NV12-like)
    or full planar.

  - Support top-left origin for output. This is only really useful
    if you are rendering directly into some memory area with top-left
    origin; most users will get the expected behavior by using
    bottom-left as before.

  - Rework uniform handling for less OpenGL overhead. Note that
    this means your effects now need to register uniforms in the
    C++ code instead of declaring them in the .frag file.

  - Make the PaddingEffect border subpixel-aware, and also support
    an arbitrary (subpixel) border offset. This means that you can
    compose PaddingEffect with an integral left/top offset
    (use the new IntegralPaddingEffect for potentially more speed)
    and ResampleEffect with a subpixel left/top offset (and zoom to
    compensate) to get Lanczos interpolation for the pixels and a
    simple bilinear interpolation for the border itself.

  - Fix a bug that could cause very bad filter weights in
    ResampleEffect.

  - Various performance improvements, in particular with regards to
    CPU usage in ResampleEffect.


Movit 1.1.3, March 29th, 2015

  - Fix accuracy issues in ResampleEffect, particularly when
    zooming. Note that this might cost a few percent performance.
    Reported by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Make the number of BlurEffect taps configurable.
    Based on patch by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Multiple other bugfixes, some courtesy Dan Dennedy and
    Christophe Thommeret. In particular, thread-safety fixes
    related to locales and chain finalization.


Movit 1.1.2, August 12th, 2014

  - Performance bugfix: Fix texture freelist behavior so that it's
    LRU instead of the exact opposite. Patch by Christophe Thommeret.

  - Performance bugfix: Correct the number of blur taps read in the
    blur filter (it was reading about twice as many as it should).
    Also found by Christophe Thommeret.


Movit 1.1.1, April 12th, 2014

 - Fix an issue that could cause assertion failure in ResourcePool
   when FBOs are reused, especially with NVIDIA's drivers.


Movit 1.1, April 10th, 2014

 - NOTE: Movit now uses libepoxy rather than GLEW. This is needed because
   of core context and GLES3 support (see below). Movit 1.1 should be
   generally API-compatible with 1.0.3 (with the exception of the next
   point), but is not ABI-compatible, so there has been a soname bump
   to libmovit.so.2.

 - NOTE: The rules for using an EffectChain or ResourcePool in multiple
   OpenGL contexts or threads have changed somewhat; see the comments in
   resource_pool.h.

 - Movit will now work in OpenGL core contexts, and on GLES 3.0 or newer.
   (GLES2 devices are not supported.) This also holds for all unit tests,
   provided that you use SDL2 and not SDL1 (because SDL2 is needed to set
   up such contexts). Note that the included demo application still requires
   a classic OpenGL context.

 - ResampleEffect can now do sub-pixel translate and/or zoom.

 - LumaMixEffect now has an “invert” flag, as a convenience to e.g. change
   a left-to-right wipe into a right-to-left one.

 - Significant reduction in driver overhead, especially on NVIDIA drivers.

 - Various smaller bugfixes and performance improvements.


Movit 1.0.3, March 16th, 2014

 - Yet more build system tweaks mainly related to distribution packaging.


Movit 1.0.2, March 16th, 2014

 - Make a few tweaks to “make install”, to make distributions' lives easier.


Movit 1.0.1, March 16th, 2014

 - Fix so that shared libraries are built.


Movit 1.0, March 16th, 2014

 - Initial release.
